## Overview

This repository contains a personal portfolio website that showcases skills, projects, education, certifications, leadership & volunteering, and ways to contact me. The website is static and implemented with plain HTML/CSS (and optionally small JavaScript). It is intended to display professional highlights for prospective employers, collaborators, and peers.

## Live demo

If deployed to GitHub Pages or a hosting provider, the live site appears at: `sanbuenaventuracathleen.github.io` (or GitHub Pages URL for this repo). For a local preview, you can open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a static server.
