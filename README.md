## About me

I’m a passionate and ambitious computer science student who enjoys continuously learning and challenging myself. Outside of academics, I spend my downtime weightlifting and connecting with like-minded individuals who share a growth-oriented mindset.

While I’m still exploring whether to pursue a career in cybersecurity or software/AI engineering after graduation, I’m deeply curious about both paths and motivated to grow wherever I can make meaningful impact. Long term, I aspire to build a business of my own that blends technology, problem-solving, and innovation.
